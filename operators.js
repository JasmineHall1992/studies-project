/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 
 * 0: (introduction)
 * Operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations.
 * 
 * 1: (explanation)
 *  Types of Operators
 * ------------------------
 * Assignment Operators
 *     ==> The assignment operator ( = ) assigns a value to a variable.
 *         Example: 
 *              let x = z + y;
 * Comparison Operators
 *     ==> Comparison Operators compare two values (two operands) and evaluate to a Boolean, true or false
 *          Example:
 *                  Binary Comparison Operators
 *                      console.log(1 < 2);
 *                  Strict Comparison Operators 
 *                      console.log(2 === 2);
 * Arithmetic Operators
 *      ==> Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers.
 *          Example:
 *              let a = 3;
 *              let x = (100 + 50) * a; 
 * Logical Operators
 *      ==> Logical operators in javascript are used to combine or modify boolean values, resulting in a true or false evaluation
 *          Example:
 *              && is the AND operator, resolves if both conditions are true.
 *              || is the OR operator, resolves if either condition is true.
 *               ! is the bang operator, this flips the truthiness of the value.ÃŸ
 * String Operators
 *      ==> String operators can be used on string values, but strings also work with the concatenation operator(+). Concatenation takes two string values and returns another string that is the union
 *          of two operand strings.
 *              Example:
 *                  var message = "Hello";
 *                  message += "World!";
 *                  console.log(message);// prints "Hello World!"
 * Ternary Operators
 *      ==> The Ternary operator takes three operands, a condition followed by a question mark(?), then an expression to execute if the confition is truthy, followed by a colon (:), and finally a conftion
 *          to execute if the condition is falsy, this is an alternative to if....else statements.
 *            Example:
 *              function getFee(isMember){
 *                  return isMember ? "$2.00" : "$10.00";
 *                   };
 * Unary Operators
 *     ==> Unary Operators is an operation with one operand
 *          Example: 
 *                console.log(typeof 1);
 *                console.lof(!true);
 *
